# Stocks-Dashboard



## Running the project <br>
To run the script you will have to install the package to call the IEX API: `$ pip install iexfinance`


## Code <br>
- From the API, we extracted data for the past 5 previous days and created a dataframe to showcase: <br> 
  - Date 
  - Closing Price 
  - Volume Traded
  - % Change in closing price
  - % Change in volume


## Data <br>
- We created a CSV file with stock symbol and the relevent keyword to identify the stock in our relevent subreddits.
